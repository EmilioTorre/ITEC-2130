 * Exercise 5:
 Write a program that prompts the user for an
 integer value. The program should then calculate
 and print the factorial of the user provided value.
 Factorial of a number, n, written as n! is calculated
 as a product of all integers less than or equal
 to n. 5! = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120. 0! = 1. 1! = 1.
