 * Exercise 9:
 Write a program that prompts the user for a String value and a character value. The program should then find the last
 occurrence of the provided character in the provided String and display the corresponding index. If the character
 is not found in the String, display -1.

 Sample output for values "Hello, World!" and 'l':
 Last occurrence of character 'l' in "Hello World" is at index 10

 Sample output for values "Hello, World!" and 'g':
 Last occurrence of character 'g' in "Hello World" is at index -1
